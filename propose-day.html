                Even if you say no a hundred times,<br>
                I'll still choose you a hundred and one times<br>
                Not to force your heart,<br>
                But to show you mine never left,<br>
                I'm not here to win you back,<br>
                I'm here to stay...quietly, softly, loving<br>
                you in all the ways you don't see.<br>
                Until the day you feel it too...<br>
                or even if you never do!!<br>
                <br>
                What if we try again? What if we give it a try?<br>
                And this time we will finally make it right<br>
                I know deep in my heart, I can't let you go, and my heart will never stop hoping you find your way back, to give us a second chance to make things right. What if love is indeed sweeter the second time around? What if we choose each other again, but this time we fight harder to stay? What if this time it could be better! What if this time it could be more of a blessing!<br>
                <br>
                Will you be my Valentine for life, I just want to see you happy!? 💗💗
