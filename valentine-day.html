                    I know you didn't say yes,<br>
                    but I know you would have!<br>
                    There are a lot of reasons why you may not want this, and don't want us<br>
                    <br>
                    I hope this was not forced at all, none of it! As a last message for this Valentine's is that, I know things are tough, hope you find your way to peace! And of course, be happy! That's all I want from you<br>
                    <br>
                    And as a last present, I have sent you something, and I am not entirely sure when it will reach you, but I will text you when it is delivered to you! Hope you like it!<br>
                    <br>
                    Happy Valentine's Day!! 💗🌹💕
