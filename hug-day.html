                I know you may not be needing my hug, or my hug may seem really unattractive now, but I do remember our first hug, and we did start with a hug!!<br>
                <br>
                Hope you remember it as well! It meant so much to me and you as well!<br>
                <br>
                It wasn't just our hands wrapped around each other, but our hearts physically closer to each other as well as our souls! We hugged every time it was time to leave, and when you got a little far, I would come back and hug you!<br>
                <br>
                Happy Hug Day, Love! Hope I can hug you someday in person!
