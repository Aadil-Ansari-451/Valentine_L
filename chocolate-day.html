                Your sweetness towards me never faded away, and it's showing even now. It was easy to leave, and I don't know what's in your heart at the moment, but you staying means a lot to me, and somewhere you want this too, or a version of you wants this!<br>
                <br>
                Please choose me if your heart wishes!<br>
                <br>
                Happy Chocolate Day!!
